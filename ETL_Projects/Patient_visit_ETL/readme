🏥 Healthcare Patient Visit ETL Pipeline

Python + SQL | Data Engineering Project

📌 Problem Statement

Healthcare systems generate patient and visit (encounter) data daily from multiple sources.
This raw data is often incomplete, duplicated, and not ready for analytics.

The goal of this project is to build a simple but realistic ETL pipeline that:

Cleans healthcare data

Joins patient and encounter information

Loads analytics-ready data into a SQL database

Enables common healthcare reporting queries

📂 Data Used

This project uses synthetic healthcare data (no real patient data).

1️⃣ Patient Data (patient.csv)

Contains patient demographic information:

patient_id

first_name

last_name

gender

dob

Data quality issues simulated:

Missing date of birth (DOB)

2️⃣ Encounter Data (encounter.csv)

Contains patient visit details:

encounter_id

patient_id

visit_date

visit_type (OPD / IPD)

facility

Data quality issues simulated:

Missing patient_id

Multiple encounters per patient

Multiple facilities

🔁 ETL Workflow
🟢 Extract

Raw CSV files are read using pandas

Source data represents daily healthcare exports

🟡 Transform

The following transformations are applied:

Remove encounters with missing patient_id (business-critical key)

Convert date fields to proper datetime format

Join patient and encounter data using patient_id

Add a row-level metric visit_count = 1 to support analytics

Each row in the transformed dataset represents one patient visit.

🔵 Load

Transformed data is loaded into a SQLite database

Final table name: patient_visits

Database file: healthcare.db

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

pandas – data extraction and transformation

SQLite – lightweight relational database

SQL – analytics and validation queries

VS Code – development and database viewing

📊 Sample SQL Queries

The following queries can be run on the patient_visits table:

🔹 View all patient visits
SELECT * FROM patient_visits;

🔹 Total visits per patient
SELECT patient_id, SUM(visit_count) AS total_visits
FROM patient_visits
GROUP BY patient_id
ORDER BY total_visits DESC;

🔹 Visits by facility
SELECT facility, COUNT(*) AS visits
FROM patient_visits
GROUP BY facility;

🔹 Visits per day
SELECT visit_date, COUNT(*) AS visits
FROM patient_visits
GROUP BY visit_date
ORDER BY visit_date;

🧠 Key Learnings

End-to-end ETL pipeline design

Healthcare data modeling (one patient → many encounters)

Data quality handling using business rules

SQL-based analytics on curated data

Clear separation of ETL logic (Python) and analytics logic (SQL)

🚀 Future Enhancements

Incremental data loading

Data quality validation framework

Fact and dimension table modeling

Migration to PostgreSQL

Dashboard integration
